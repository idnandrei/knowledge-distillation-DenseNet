# knowledge-distillation-DenseNet

This project harnesses the power of TensorFlow and a wide range of supporting Python libraries to create an advanced machine learning solution. It is designed to offer efficient, scalable, and state-of-the-art tools for your data-driven tasks, including data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Overview

### Core Framework
- **TensorFlow**: At the heart of this project, TensorFlow provides the tools to build, train, and deploy machine learning models efficiently, with support for both CPU and GPU acceleration.
- **TensorFlow-Metal & TensorFlow-MacOS**: Optimized for macOS devices, these packages enhance performance on Apple silicon hardware, leveraging the Metal API for GPU computation.

### Supporting Libraries
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API within TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models.
- **TensorBoard**: Integrated tools for monitoring model training, debugging, and performance evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn** and **Statsmodels**: Essential libraries for traditional machine learning tasks and statistical modeling.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: Advanced visualization tools to explore data and model outputs.

### Utilities and Enhancements
- **Pandas** and **Numpy**: Provide robust data manipulation and numerical computation capabilities.
- **H5py** and **protobuf**: Efficient data serialization and handling for saving and loading model artifacts.
